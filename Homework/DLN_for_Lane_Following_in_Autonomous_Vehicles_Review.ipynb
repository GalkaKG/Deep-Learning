    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The paper presents a novel deep-learning approach for lane following in autonomous vehicles. The authors integrate **VGG16** and **Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)** to create a hybrid deep-learning network that accurately predicts the steering angle and speed necessary for effective lane-keeping. \n",
    "\n",
    "The study utilizes both simulated (**Udacity dataset**) and real-world datasets, evaluating the proposed method's performance in terms of **mean square error (MSE), inference time, and computational efficiency**.\n",
