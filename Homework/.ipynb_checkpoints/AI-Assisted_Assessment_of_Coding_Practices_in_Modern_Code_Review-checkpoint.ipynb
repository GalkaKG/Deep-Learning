    "## Context of the Topic\n",
    "Modern code review is a critical process in software development, ensuring that code contributions adhere to best practices before integration into the main codebase. While some best practices can be automatically verified, many rely on human reviewers, making the process time-consuming and subject to human error. \n",
    "\n",
    "The article introduces **\"AutoCommenter,\"** a system leveraging **large language models (LLMs)** to automatically learn and enforce coding best practices across multiple programming languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Importance of the Topic for Deep Learning\n",
    "The integration of AI, particularly **large language models**, into code review processes represents a significant advancement in software engineering. By automating the assessment of coding practices, AI can enhance the **efficiency, consistency, and scalability** of code reviews, allowing human reviewers to focus on more complex and nuanced aspects of code quality.\n",

    "- **Multi-Language Support:** Implemented for **C++, Java, Python, and Go**, allowing broad applicability across different projects.\n",
    "- **Integration:** Seamlessly integrates into **existing code review workflows**, providing **automated feedback** to developers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ðŸ”¹ Evaluation and Results\n",
    "The authors deployed AutoCommenter in a **large industrial setting**, involving **tens of thousands of developers**. The evaluation focused on the system's **feasibility, performance, and impact on developer workflows**. \n",
    "\n",
    "The results indicated that **AutoCommenter effectively learned and enforced coding best practices**, leading to **a positive impact on the code review process**. The study also discusses **challenges encountered during deployment** and **lessons learned**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ðŸ”¹ Real-World Applications\n",
    "AutoCommenter can be applied in **large-scale software development environments** to **automate the enforcement of coding best practices**. By providing **consistent and automated feedback** during code reviews, it enhances **code quality** and reduces the burden on human reviewers.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "The article presents a **significant advancement** in **automating code reviews through AI**. **AutoCommenter** demonstrates that a **large language model can effectively learn and enforce coding best practices** across **multiple programming languages**.
